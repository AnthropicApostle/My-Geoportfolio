		This website is the geoportfolio of Kyle Maljevac. The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of surveying and geospatial science
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and as of September 2024, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) (Honours) course. My surveying-related interests is working with traverse, collection and analysis of
		surveying data, practical software such as LISCAD and AutoCAD.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include editing, writing, academic research in humanities and travelling!

		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and a first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->
		<p>
			Below are the maps that I have created as part of my course:

	<div class="bar"><h2>Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you have done yourself-->
	<div class="paragraphs">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a unique but very practical and interesting subject done in both geospatial science and surveying. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		For the 2021 version of the course which I completed, the assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		Parks Victoria has planned development at Deep Rock Oval at Yarra Park which will propose an amphitheatre constructed around this area.
		This proposal will also include introducing several native plant species to the location such as River Red
		Gum for the sites Canopy, Tree Violet as a shrub for the area and Common Tussockgrass as the ground story layer for the
		area. These layers of vegetation will help preserve these iconic plants which are endemic to Australia and provide a beautiful aesthetic
		and decorative ora for the surrounding area. The development of the proposal will also include the introduction of new roads, footpaths,
		parking and toilet blocks for public use. These plans will help revitalise the site as a community park while improving the current
		environment, habitat and vegetation growth for the area that is iconic to Australia

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2024) within the infastructure surveying industry. The two main companies that I have worked at

	<div class="job-overview">
		My time at Fulton Hogan was a 4 month period of working as an assistant for various senior surveyors. The work experience subject taught me a lot about what industry
		standard work is done within the surveying industry. I chose to work at Fulton Hogan as I read about it online on how it is a large company that does a lot of
		surveying activity and to my personal knowledge, is one of the few companies that specialise in different forms of infastructure surveying work as their primary
		source of business. The work at Fulton Hogan in 
		the Melbourne office was less about performing geospatial analysis on pre-existing data, but rather capturing and collecting their own spatial data which 
		the mapping team process and edit into a usable form for the client.
		<p>
		As part of the surveying team, the work I was exposed to was Experience in office work and with field practical surveying, including setting up practical equipment 
		and gathering data from Total Stations, GPS and Levelling equipment. This experience has helped shape my surveying abilities as I was starting out in the industry.

		My work at TAYLORS as part of the surevying team involves using the LISCAD suite for producing figures and maps for both internal staff members from other

		editing the pre-existing data to be updated or creating new figures and information for visualisation on the maps. A lot of the work requires knowledge of
		surevying language and sorting through spatial databases.
